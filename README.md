# Dashboard-Full

Full dashboard that I wrote to manage up to 2.400 IG Accounts on a single t2.small VPS.

Deployment was done using AWS (Beanstalk, EC2, Amplify, Route 53).
Database management is done by a free cluster on MongoDB.
Used selenium for the browser automation.

<b>Benefits</b>

<li> Main products in the market require powerful VPS to manage just 50 accounts this one just needs a t2.small to manage 2.400 VPS and even more with a proper use of multithreading</li>

<li> Reverse engineer of the API to make DMS, Scrape Followers and Hashtags </li>

<li> With a proper use of the login endpoint of Instagram the dashboard could get rid of the Selenium usage and move everything to the Node.js Server </li>

<li> Scrape of Graphql </li>
